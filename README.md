goSell Payment Gateway accepts online payments. You can integrate with it in a different way based on your app's specifications.

The new version of goSell Payment Gateway provides:

**goSell Checkout**: It's a simple way to integrate goSell with a few client side code.

goSell Checkout includes two different integrations based on your preferences:

- goSell LightBox: open a light box / modal dialog inside your store.

- goSell Payment Page: open goSell payment gateway directly without server side code or making any REST API Requests.

**goSell Elements**: two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side actions. goSell securely will collect your customerâ€™s payment information and returns a card token, then your server-side code can make an API request from the available REST APIs on https://tap.company/developers to complete the process based on your needs (by create a charge / authorize or saving the customer card).
